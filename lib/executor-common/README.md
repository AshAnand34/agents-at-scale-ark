# Executor Common

⚠️ **DEPRECATED** - This package has been moved to `ark-sdk`.

## Migration

The functionality of this package has been consolidated into the main `ark-sdk` package. Please see the [Migration Guide](MIGRATION.md) for details on how to update your code.

## What Was Here

This package previously contained:

- **`types.py`** - Shared type definitions for execution requests/responses
- **`app.py`** - Base FastAPI application setup with common patterns  
- **`base.py`** - Abstract base classes for executors

All of this functionality is now available in `ark-sdk` with improved integration and reduced duplication.
