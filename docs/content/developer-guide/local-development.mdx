# Local Development

For local development, [DevSpace](https://www.devspace.sh/) can be used for live-reload of the controller, APIs and dashboard.

Install `devspace` with:

```bash
brew install devspace
```

Deploy the controller, Ark APIs and dashboard and run with live-reload:

```bash
devspace dev
```

The controller and services are deployed with their full-fat production Helm charts, but the production images are swapped out for 'dev' images - these dev images contain all of the services needed for live reload and so on. Your local code is synched into the dev containers. Development containers have `devspace` in the name, such as `ark-controller-devspace`.

When you are ready to build the final production containers and test with those, just run:

```bash
devspace deploy
```

To remove all devspace containers, run:

```bash
devspace purge
```
