# Local Development

> [!NOTE]
>
> DevSpace is being integrated for improved local development experience with hot reload and file sync. Currently configured for `ark-api` and `ark-dashboard` services with full development workflow support.

DevSpace builds and deploys ARK services with live reload, debugger support in IDEs, and file synchronization for rapid iteration. Currently DevSpace is enabled for:

- `ark-api` - The ARK API layer with FastAPI hot reload
- `ark-dashboard` - The ARK Dashboard with Next.js Turbopack compilation

## Essential Commands

```bash
# Development mode with hot reload and file sync
devspace dev

# Build images and deploy to cluster without development features
devspace deploy

# Clean up deployment
devspace purge

# View logs
devspace logs -f
```
