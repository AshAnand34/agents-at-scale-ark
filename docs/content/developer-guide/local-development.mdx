# Local Development

> [!NOTE]
>
> Local development is being migrated to DevSpace for improved developer experience with hot reload and file sync. Currently available for `ark-api` service, with the rest of the stack coming soon.

DevSpace supports the developer experience by deploying your containers with your Helm charts, enabling live reload, debugger support in IDEs, and file synchronization. DevSpace is currently configured for `ark-api`.

## Essential Commands

```bash
# Build images and deploy to cluster without development features
devspace deploy

# Development mode with hot reload and file sync
devspace dev

# Clean up deployment
devspace purge

# View logs
devspace logs -f
```
