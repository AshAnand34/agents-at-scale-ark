# ARK Controller Local Development

Run the ARK controller on your local machine instead of in the cluster.

/>

## Usage

Stop the cluster controller:
```bash
cd ark && make eject-controller
```

Run the controller locally:
```bash
cd ark && make dev
```

That's it! The local controller connects to your cluster and processes ARK resources.
