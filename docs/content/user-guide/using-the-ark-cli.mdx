# Using the ARK CLI

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g @agents-at-scale/ark
```

## Basic Usage

```bash
# Enable tab completion (add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc)
eval "$(ark completion bash)"  # For bash
eval "$(ark completion zsh)"   # For zsh

# Start interactive chat
ark chat

# Chat with a specific target
ark chat agent/math

# Enable streaming responses (disabled by default)
ARK_ENABLE_STREAMING=1 ark chat

# Enable markdown rendering for assistant responses (disabled by default)
ARK_ENABLE_MARKDOWN=1 ark chat

# Enable both streaming and markdown
ARK_ENABLE_STREAMING=1 ARK_ENABLE_MARKDOWN=1 ark chat
```

Then query any agent:

```
> @weather What's the weather today?
> @math Calculate 15 * 23
```

That's it! The CLI maintains conversation context and lets you interact with any deployed ARK agents.

## Local Development

```bash
# Navigate to the CLI source
cd tools/ark-cli

# Create global symlink
npm link --force

# Run directly or with live reload
ark         # Run the CLI
npm run dev # Or run with live reload
```

Changes to the source code will instantly reflect when you run `ark` commands.
